## Project Description

## How to run the code

- Install the required packages from the pyproject.toml file. I use `uv` for this.
- In order to run the ILP model, you need a Gurobi license. You can get a free academic license from [here](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).
- The ILP model is in `gurobi_global.py`, and this will make a nice browser-based visualization of the results.
